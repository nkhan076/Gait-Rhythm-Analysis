The article presents the analysis of signals measured from patients with Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS) in order to discover some dynamic biomarkers. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's
disease, is a neurodegenerative disease where the neurons controlling muscles that perform
voluntary actions (motor neurons) are destroyed slowly with time. The cause of the disease is not
known but there is evidence that it can be inherited genetically. The authors of the article
introduced a hypothesis i.e. subjects with ALS would have an altered gait rhythm from the normal
rhythm and then perform analysis to prove the hypothesis. These variations would be increase in
the magnitude of the stride-to-stride fluctuation and perturbations in the fluctuation dynamics. In
order to prove the hypothesis, the authors followed signal processing approaches such as the
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), autocorrelation of the stride time series, normalized nonstationarity index for stride intervals and the fluctuation dynamics. They compared the results of
these analysis for patients with ALS with that of healthy patients and also with that of Parkinsons
Disease (PD) and Huntington Disease (HD) patients. The authors found their results to be
supportive of their hypothesis. This could hence be potentially used to characterize the biomarkers
for motor control in ALS.
